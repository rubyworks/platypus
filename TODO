overload.rb needs an overhaul!

Take a look at the github "Functor" project (yea I know, terrible name for a overload system!) and see if that design
isn't a better approach.

Otherwise, just clean up the current code --main issue is the use of xGeneric aliases.

* Look to implement to_int, to_mailtext, to_r, to_rfc822text and to_str.
