# Developer's Notes

## 2011-10-19 Name of Project

This project used to be call Typecast. Maybe that was better than the "silly" 
Platypus name? But, then again, "typecast" doesn't quite cover everything this
library does.

## 2010-05-27 Alias for Overloadable#overload

I am not sure if I like +con+, +sig+ or +over+ better as a short alias for +overload+. I thought of +con+ becuase of it's double meaning as Latin for 'with' and as an abbreviation for 'conditional'. But it seems esoteric in practice, perhaps b/c it would be too general a term if we were programming in Spanish. While +over+ probably makes the most sense in terms of being an abbreviated form of +overload+, +sig+ is the same number of characters as +def+ and conveys some additional semantics which applies to method overloading --the *signature*.
